find and replace all the items in a column based on a lookup table. Inputs are the column and table

<<<<<<< HEAD
## STEP 1
create a csv file (lookup table) that looks like this using the same heading names

|FIND   |REPLACE    |
| ----- | --------- |
|x      |y          |
|fast   |Fast       |
|somth  |something  |

## STEP 2
put the input variables into the .py script.

- csv file path
- path to lookup table in step 1
- name of column to apply the find and replace to
- csv delimiter
- filename for the output data

## STEP 3
run the code. All done.
=======
The lookup table is a csv file with columns 'FIND' and 'REPLACE'.

In the code replace the name of the column 'SAMPLEPOINT' with whatever column you want to apply the find and replace to.
